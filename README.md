I recently cleared the Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate exam, and I want to share my experience to help others who are preparing for it.

My Experience & Study Tips

The exam is 90 minutes / 45 questions and heavily scenario-based, so donâ€™t expect pure theory. Time management is very important. I prepared through the Databricks Academy learning path, hands-on labs, and documentation (especially on DLT, Auto Loader, and Unity Catalog). Honestly, hands-on practice made all the difference.

I also found the practice questions from certifiedumps extremely helpful for reinforcing concepts and getting exam-ready.
